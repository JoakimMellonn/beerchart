# beerchart
The beer-chart web app, is an React app accompanying the beer-app, to show a live chart of the current "standings". If this is wanted you can easily set up the beer-chart to the same back end as the beer-app is running. Please do be aware that the beer-app is needed to use this.

# Prerequisites
These are the things you will need when setting up and running the beer-app.

- A computer (duh).
- Some kind of code editor, I don't care what you use.
- The beer-app set up and running, read more about it [here](https://github.com/JoakimMellonn/beerapp).
- A Google account.
- Some knowledge about how to troubleshoot development tools (I don't guarantee everything will always go smoothly).

# Set up the app
This will guide you through how to set up and run the app.

## Clone git repo
Open the terminal at some place on your computer, where you want to have the project located and run the below command.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/JoakimMellonn/beerchart.git
```

## Set up Firebase
Go to the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and choose the project you use with the beer-app. Click the `</>` logo to add a web app to the project. Follow the guide on Firebase to add the React app, if you want you can also set up Firebase hosting to host the web app.

# Reporting an issue
At the top of this page, choose the "Issues" tab. Search or browse to see if an issue already exists. If not click "New issue" and describe the issue you're experiencing as best as possible. I will get around to fixing it as fast as possible, but I am a student with limited time.

# Contributing to the project
If you have created something awesome you think should be a permanent part of the app, please do create a pull request to contribute to the project!

To do this create a new git branch locally, make your changes, commit and create a pull request. Google has a much better answer than I do on how to do this, plus I'm too lazy to write this part of the guide.
